## How to Run

1. Download and Prepare MNIST Data:
   - Ensure the MNIST dataset files are located in the `./data/MNIST/raw/` directory:
     - `train-images.idx3-ubyte`
     - `train-labels.idx1-ubyte`
     - `t10k-images.idx3-ubyte`
     - `t10k-labels.idx3-ubyte`
   
2. Run the Script:
   - Execute the script in your Python environment:
     ```
     python Assignment1.py
     ```
   - The script will:
     - Load and preprocess the MNIST data.
     - Train the neural network with specified hyperparameters.
     - Perform grid search over various hyperparameters (iterations, batch size, batch normalization, L2 regularization).
     - Plot and save loss and accuracy graphs for training and validation sets.

3. Results:
   - The best hyperparameters and their corresponding accuracy will be printed.
   - Loss and accuracy graphs will be saved as PNG files.


## Hyperparameters

You can adjust the following hyperparameters in the script:

- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.
- `layers_dims`: List defining the architecture of the neural network.
- `num_iterations`: List of iteration values for grid search.
- `batch_size`: List of batch sizes for grid search.
- `batch_norm`: List of boolean values to enable/disable batch normalization.
- `L2_reg`: List of L2 regularization values for grid search.
